# Programming and Quant Finance Bootcamp 2024 - Mike Fuller

# Overview

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that I have written to assist my learning whilst studying for my self-created **Programming and Quant Finance Bootcamp (PQFB)**. I have kept the details of the bootcamp private, such as the reading list, granular objectives, and exercises, but provide a brief overview below.

The PQFB consists of two learning tracks: a Python Programming track (PQF-1) and a Quantitative Finance track (PQF-2).

PQF-1 explores the foundations of the Python programming language and helps the reader to build their confidence and proficiency in the language through Python-based data analysis and machine learning projects. 

PQF-2 studies a selection of mathematical techniques and background knowledge from the field of quantitative finance, with integrated projects in derivatives pricing and risk management.

Each learning track consists of 6 sections, the first half of which both follow a similar pattern of independent reading, followed by set exercises and mini-projects. Both tracks contain integrated projects in their penultimate sections which aim to bring together content from the entire track. The final sections are reserved for portfolio refinement. The learning tracks are (reasonably) independent of each other, up until the later stages when integrated projects are completed.

# Objectives

The high-level objectives of the PQFB are to:

1. Provide structured content that builds the skill set required in a typical Quantitative Developer role at a financial institution, such as an asset management or trading firm;

2. Enable the reader to bolster their portfolio through the use of integrated projects.

# Schedule

This bootcamp is designed to be completed at a relaxed but consistent pace, with both learning tracks being completed in parallel. We assume that most readers will be completing the content in conjunction with an existing full-time job, and as such do not provide strict deadlines or timelines. For the more serious reader, the bootcamp should aim to be completed over 6 months. This assumes at least two evenings of study per week (one evening per week for each learning track).
